Here's how to navigate PRS:
Once you're logged in, which will display at the top right of your screen, you've got five basic parts: 
<a routerLink="/user/list">users</a>, 
<a routerLink="/vendor/list">vendors</a>, 
<a routerLink="/product/list">products</a>, 
<a routerLink="/request/list">requests</a>, and
<a routerLink="/request/review-lines">reviews</a>. 

This is your guide to what they do.

<div>
    Users is your home for all the members of the staff. Every employee has an account with certain privileges.
    Only admins can create a new user when someone is hired or change a user's information. Admins and reviewers have different 
    privileges from each other, and additional privilages to users. If you cannot access something on the site, your privileges could be why.
    In the user part of PRS, you can add, edit, and delete users based on what your login allows you to do.

    Vendors is the home for the companies Dunder Mifflin purchases from. Similarly to users, vendors can be added, edited, and deleted.
    Vendors are connected to the products they provide, which all come together in the requests.
